# Section Metadata

Sections are a way to group default content and blocks by the author. Most of the time section breaks are introduced
based on visual differences between sections such as a different background color for a part of a page.

# Usage

A Section is represented by a leading `---` and a trailing `---`. The Section Metadata Table is being added at the end of the section.
Section Metadata allows the author to add two parameters to a section table with the following attributes (1st column)

`---`

| Section Metadata |                             |
|------------------| --------------------------- |
| Style            | [see style options below]   |
| background-image | [image]                     |
